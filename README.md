# spatie-roleper
A complete preference of setting Role/Permission for the users by using laravel package

git clone https://github.com/kamranraz28/spatie-roleper.git

After cloning the project you will see a file name .env-main
rename this file to .env

Run this command:
composer update

Download database .sql file "roleper.sql" if it's not downloaded yet from my repository. 
create a new database "roleper" to your mysql database and import the databse here.

After that run the project:
php artisan serve
